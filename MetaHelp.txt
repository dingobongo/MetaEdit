[About]

MetaGenerator is designed to help you quickly generate usefull metadata & insert it quickly into .wav files.

[Use]
1. Before you start using MetaGenerator you needs some wav files. These should have appropriate names as the name will be used to generate some of your metadata.

Ie
Thing Action(s) Mic Channels Take.wav
or
Bike Skidd Concrete Various DPA 4060 LR 01

2. Open Meta Generator and use the "Open Folder" button to open a dialogue and navigate to the folder where your files are. 
The tool supports subfolders so you can break up your files that way if you want.

3. You can now add more metadata, some may be filled out for you allready by eather the defaults.ini or generated ie time/date.
The description fields Project, Session and Recordists will be added to the generated description. The description will be made up from your provided fileneme.


4. When you're done click the "write csv" button, this will generate and open a .csv file that the tool can later understand.
You can do further editing of the metadata here but don't change the Column title s or the file path otherewise the next step will not work.

Once your're done with editing the metadata save the .csv and close it.

5.Now you can actually write the data into the .wav files. To do this just click the "write wavs" button. This may take a while but the tool will let you know when its complete.
Your files now should have all the metadata you input written into them.

[Defaults]
There is a defaoults file called MetaDefaults.ini, edit this with noepad++ or similar.

There you can add default values that are automaticaly added to the named fields on the opening of the tool. 
This may be handy if you're working on one project or are the only recordist of your files or use one folder for sound editing.
